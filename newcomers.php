                <small>Hail and Well Met!</small>
            </h1>
            <p>Did you ever dream of brave knights in armor, fair maidens,
              attending a royal court, or a candlelit feast?  Were you
              fascinated by tales of the round table and wish you were part of
              the adventure and romance?  Well, you’re in luck, for the Society
              of Creative Anachronism – these are the Current Middle Ages.</p>
            <p>The Society for Creative Anachronism or SCA, is a non-profit
              organization dedicated to the study and recreation of pre-
              seventeenth century European culture.  Since its beginning as a
              May Day celebration in 1966, the SCA has grown into an
              international organization with branches throughout the U.S.,
              Canada, Europe and Australia.</p>
            <p>Members do not merely undertake the dry study of history or
              attempt to re-create the romance and chivalry of a time recorded
              in the legends of King Arthur and Charlemagne. We have fun
              relearning the skills and crafts of the bygone era and believe the
              “how’s” and “why’s” of history are best understood when you try
              your own hands at re-creating some period project, experience a
              taste of medieval life by pursuing such ancient skills as:
              heraldry, calligraphy, weaving, archery, leather-crafting,
              dancing, and MORE!</p>
            <p>Like other historical re-creation groups, the most colorful of
              the SCA’s activities take place on weekends.  Members meet at
              campgrounds around the country for tournaments, revels and feasts.
              The gatherings may attract any number from a hundred or more to a
              thousand participants. It is not necessary to become a registered
              member to participate.  The only requirement for participation is
              courtesy and willingness to wear medieval costume at official
              events.</p>
            <p>The local SCA Chapter centered in New Orleans is the Barony of
              Axemoor.  We hold meetings regularly on the first Tuesday of each
              month at 7pm (check the calendar for location). In addition, we
              hold medieval combat practices, these include Heavy Fighting,
              Rapier and, when avaliable, Archery and Thrown Weapons. Please
              check the calendar for activity times and locations.</p>
